        <h1>  Fishing </h1>                                                                                                                                                                                                     
    <h6>  Sport fishing is normally done with a fishing rod and line with any number of hooks to get the fish. This method is called angling. There may be rules that say how many lines and hooks one fisherman can use and how many fish he can catch. Anglers in fresh water catch many Black Bass (Black Bass includes the entire range of Bass fish), Pike, Muskellunge, Perch, Carp, Trout, Salmon, and Sunfish. Fish people get in saltwater include Swordfish, Marlin, Tuna, and others.

Rules generally do not allow the use of nets and catching fish with hooks not in the mouth. However some kinds of fish can be taken with nets for bait and a few for food. Non-sport fish that are not said to be worth as much can sometimes be taken by many ways like snagging, bow and arrow, or even gun, because they are seen as competing with more valuable fish.

Recreational fishing laws also include other life that lives in water, such as frogs and turtles.

Sport fishing can be a contest where fishermen try to get more fish than other fishermen. This sport came from local fishing contests into a large contest in the U.S.A. where skilled fishermen can compete and be helped out by companies giving prize money, and other large contests around the world. Catch-and-release fishing is increasingly practiced especially by fly fishermen, as well as spin and bait casting fishermen, to increase conservation and to protect rare fish such as marlin. The practice is however disputed as it by some is considered unethical to perform painful actions to the fish for fun and not for the reason of food production. Because of this, catch-and-release practice is illegal in Norway. The term fishing embraces all aspects of man’s pur­suit of the aquatic animals in the seas and in inland waters all over the world. A very wide variety of methods is employed. Men were hunters and fishermen before they became cultivators, and fishing is therefore one of the oldest occupations of mankind.

Increasing human numbers will make the efficient harvesting of food from the sea more and more important. Fish are a vital source of food, especially in countries like Norway, Iceland and Japan where the land is bleak or mountainous and agriculture cannot be easily de­veloped; and fish are also caught and processed to produce lubricants, fertilizers or cosmetics.

Moreover, modern fisheries are not confined to catching fish, but include many other sea harvests such as whales, seals, pearls, crustaceans (i.e., lobsters, crabs, prawns, shrimps), molluscs (i.e. oysters, mussels, cockles, clams), sponges and seaweeds.

However it must not be assumed that fish and other marine animals are an inexhaustible resource. Indeed, there are vast areas of the oceans which have very few fish. Many factors affect the productivity of the seas; the depth of the water, the ocean currents, the temperature and salinity determine the amount of plankton or fish-food present. In a way fishing is like mining; it is a robber industry. If men catch fish at a rate faster than nature can replace them, there will eventually be very few left. With faster, highly-powered boats and extremely efficient and deadly ‘weapons’ for harvesting fish, many parts of the world are already faced by a great decline in the annual fish catch. Men now have to go further into the oceans to bring ashore sufficient hauls to meet their daily needs.

Overfishing and es­pecially the wasteful killing of immature fish must be checked, not just by individual countries, but, as fish know no national boundaries, on an international basis. Fish protection and conservation measures in world fisheries must be promptly acted upon by all nations if the supply of this important source of human food is to be preserved. In terms of food value, fish are in no way inferior to other forms of meat. They are tasty, tender and easily digestible. Different kinds of fish vary in their palatability and individual taste, while different methods of preparation (fresh, pickled, kippered or smoked) and of cooking (steaming, boiling or frying) mean that fish suit almost every taste and are highly prized all round the world. Moreover, fish and other marine products are rich in proteins which help in body-building or replace worn-out tissues. Their fat provides energy and forms a valuable source of reserve food for the human body. Many essential minerals are found in fish including iron, calcium, iodine, copper, magnesium and phosphorus, in relatively greater pro­portions than in many other foods. Fish-liver oils, e.g. cod-liver oil, are a very rich source of vitamins A and D. In fact, almost three-quarters of the total fish catch is used for food, whether fresh or processed.

Besides providing human food, fish and their by-­products are equally useful in many other ways. The fish wastes from canneries are made into fish-meals, glues, oils and fertilizers. Whales provide an even greater range of industrial products. Before the in­vention of electricity or the discovery of petroleum, whale oil was the chief lamp-fuel and lubricant.

It is now used for the manufacture of soap, margarine, paints, ink and linoleum. Other by-products like wax and ambergris are used for cosmetics and perfumes and the bones and flesh are ground up for fertilizer. The skins of sea mammals like seals and walruses provide excellent fur clothing materials.

Other industries, besides those dealing directly with fish, are stimulated by fishing. These include shipbuilding and repairing, the manufacture of nets and other equipment, the construction of boxes or of tin cans for packing and the making of salt, ice or other preservatives.
